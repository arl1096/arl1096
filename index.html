  <p>Our company is called <strong> B squared </strong>. It is about when you buy any baby item we send baby blankets to children in need. <br>
    <br>
    Our company was founded in 2017 by Andria Loiacono. It originally started with just giving baby blankets but has expanded into 
    much more such as giving formula to families in need or cribs. <br>
    <br>
    When the company first started we never expected it to take off as 
    well as it has the last few years. More people buy from our website because they feel happy that everytime they buy something we give one to a family in need. <br>
    <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold">Why work with us</span>: Our main goal is to help others while also accommodating customers' needs. We understand that not everyone is fortunate enough to buy everything they need when having a baby. Our products are made from recycled goods and organic ingredients.</p>
